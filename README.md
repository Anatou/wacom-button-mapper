# wacom-button-mapper
An python program using xsetwacom to map the buttons of your wacom tablet and pen
I made this because of a bug preventing me from mapping my button over bluetooth
This app is not finished, it's a minimium viable product because I'm lazy

The python script uses os, json, subprocess, and pynput, I know I could cut the number of library by half

I made a cool logo if you want to make a clean .desktop file from the app
