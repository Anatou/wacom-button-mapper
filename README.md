# wacom-button-mapper
An python program using xsetwacom to map the buttons of your wacom tablet and pen

I made this because of a bug preventing me from mapping my button over bluetooth

This app is not finished, it's a minimium viable product because I'm lazy. Yes the code is ugly
## What do you need for the "app"
The python script uses os, json, subprocess, and pynput, I know I could cut the number of library by half

You need all the wacom drivers and library for your system too 

## Cool logo
I made a cool logo if you want to make a nice .desktop file for the app
